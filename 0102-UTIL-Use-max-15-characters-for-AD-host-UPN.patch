Subject: [PATCH 102/102] UTIL: Use max 15 characters for AD host UPN
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We do not want to use host principal with AD
"host/name.domain.tld@DOMAIN.TLD" because it does not work.
We need to use correct user principal for AD hosts. And we cannot
rely all fallback "*$" because of other principals in keytab.

The NetBIOS naming convention allows for 16 characters in a NetBIOS
name. Microsoft, however, limits NetBIOS names to 15 characters and
uses the 16th character as a NetBIOS suffix.
