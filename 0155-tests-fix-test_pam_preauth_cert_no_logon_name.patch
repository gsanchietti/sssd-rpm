Subject: [PATCH 155/160] tests: fix test_pam_preauth_cert_no_logon_name()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently a name is provided for test_pam_preauth_cert_no_logon_name()
so it is not a no-logon-name test. This patch removes the name and adds
the now missing mocked reply manually.

Reviewed-by: Fabiano FidÃªncio <fidencio@redhat.com>
(cherry picked from commit 89ff140d7ab92fce52d6730a7d27c8d73c7d9e4a)
